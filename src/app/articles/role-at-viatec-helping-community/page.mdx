After my stint with ATG Pharma and exploring the realm of entrepreneurship through various ventures, including Dr.Doc AI, I found myself at a crossroads. The thought of returning to a software engineering or developer role crossed my mind, but I yearned for something more. I've realized that while I am a proficient coder, coding itself is not what I want to center my career around. I thrive on solving problems for customers, using coding as a tool to craft solutions. This realization led me to seek a new avenue where I could leverage my skills and passions more broadly.

Enter VIATEC, Victoria's leading not-for-profit organization dedicated to fostering the growth of the local tech sector. Joining VIATEC, I've embarked on a journey to contribute through special projects, aiming to assist as many tech businesses as possible. My role at VIATEC is more than just a job; it's a mission to help propel the local tech sector to achieve a $10 billion valuation by 2030. By immersing myself in the tech community and understanding the diverse challenges faced by tech businesses, I'm in a unique position to identify problems that need solving.

My current focus is on scouting for the next big idea. Through my work with VIATEC, I've encountered several intriguing concepts that I believe have the potential for significant market demand and pull. Adopting my indie developer mindset, I'm conducting experiments on these ideas to gauge their traction and potential to scale from 0 to 1, at a pace and magnitude that would attract venture capital investment. My goal for 2024 is to dedicate myself to helping the community and piloting venture experiments on ideas that not only excite me but also have the potential to achieve product-market fit on a venture scale.

If any of these experiments show promising signs of growth and meet the investment criteria within the expected timeframe, I will eagerly share my findings and progress in a future article. Meanwhile, I'm open to connecting with tech companies in Victoria. If you're a part of this vibrant tech community and are facing challenges or pondering over new ideas, I'm here to help. As a member of VIATEC, my objective is not just to contribute to our collective mission but to also find that next venture that resonates with my skills and passion for problem-solving.

Let's chat and explore how we can collaborate to overcome hurdles and seize opportunities. Together, we can push the boundaries of innovation and contribute to the flourishing of Victoria's tech ecosystem.
