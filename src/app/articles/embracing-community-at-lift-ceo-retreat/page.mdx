Relocating to Victoria, BC in the heart of the pandemic in 2020, I embarked on a remote entrepreneurial journey, founding CastleClock with my buddy Ahmed. However, the virtual landscape often felt isolating, fueling my quest for a tech community connection.

Having collaborated with Dan Gunn from VIATEC for ScaleYYJ, a venture to invigorate the local tech scene, my efforts paved the way to an invitation to the Lift CEO Retreat. Nestled in the serene Poets Cove on Pender Island, I found myself amidst 24 remarkable individuals.

The knowledge reservoir amongst the CEOs was vast, and their experiences invaluable. One resonating advice was to steer clear of on-the-spot decisions during discussions. Instead, taking a moment post-discussion to reflect and then decisively guide the team is often more effective. Another profound realization revolved around stress – its insidious tendency to spill over into unrelated facets of our lives if not addressed promptly.

However, beyond these practical takeaways, it was the sense of community that left an indelible mark on me. Gordy Bal’s intense meditation, which entailed locking eyes with every participant for a minute, albeit challenging, fostered an unparalleled bond.

Among the myriad of personalities, Lawrence Lewis of OneFeather stood out with his mission to empower indigenous communities through fintech. Curtis Machek's ingenious text messaging solution for radio stations, working parallelly with giants like Twilio, showcased sheer talent. Shane Sparks, with his unwavering convictions, provided a fresh perspective on balancing family with entrepreneurship. Dr. Jennie Christensen’s venture, leveraging hair analysis through lasers to gauge mineral and toxin levels in the body, epitomized innovation.

While the retreat was brimming with inspiring figures like Casey, Christina, Humara, James, John, Rob, and more, detailing each would be a mammoth task. Perhaps future articles could delve into individual profiles.

As I reminisce about the retreat, the anticipation to elevate Victoria's tech ecosystem with VIATEC and the newfound community fills me with excitement. The journey ahead is promising.
