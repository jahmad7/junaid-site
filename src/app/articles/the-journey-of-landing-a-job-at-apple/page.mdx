From the bustling corridors of university to the sleek, pristine ambiance of Apple Markville, my journey was nothing short of a rollercoaster. It was 2017, the threshold between academic pressure and the lure of the real world beckoned, and amidst this, I decided to set foot in the world of Apple retail.

Despite what people might think, the application phase at Apple wasn’t the real challenge. Submit a compelling cover letter and a decent resume, and you're almost sure to get an interview. But this is where the real game began. Apple conducts group interviews – a setup where about a dozen aspirants sit in a room, engage in discussions, while the Apple folks observe, and yes, take meticulous notes. It's smart when you think about it. How better to assess potential employees for a customer service role than to see how they interact in a group setting?

Thanks to my diligent research (shoutout to Reddit!), I knew what awaited me. During the group discussion, I ensured I was the storyteller, the one who made people laugh. Post-discussion, they asked if anyone had questions. Tip: Always have a question. I made a playful inquiry about taking a sneak-peek into the storeroom, the "realm where the magic unfolds". Though I was met with chuckles and a polite decline, that question left an impression.

Three interview rounds might seem excessive for a retail job, but remember, this is Apple. The second round was with Chris, the floor manager. Rather than a conventional interview, it felt more like an insightful chat about life. The final hurdle was a tête-à-tête with Adrean, the store manager. We delved deep, touching on life choices, challenges, and personal growth. A poignant moment was recounting the heart-wrenching confession to my parents about my disinterest in medical school. Their dreams juxtaposed with mine, but they eventually understood.

The call from Adrean a few weeks later brought exhilarating news – I had clinched the job! But the adventure was just beginning. Up next was a two-week training at Apple’s head office. The training was, to put it mildly, a whirlwind of learning and amazement. Stay tuned for Part 2 where I delve into the heart of Apple's renowned training regime.
