The transition from founding a startup to joining a non-profit tech organization was an interesting experiment. When I joined VIATEC, I came with high hopes and ambitious plans to accelerate Victoria's tech ecosystem. What I discovered was a valuable lesson in the realities of government-adjacent organizations and the pace at which they operate.

Working at VIATEC was an enlightening experience. Under Dan Gunn's leadership, I gained invaluable insights into how a cornerstone organization of Victoria's tech community operates. The dedication to supporting local tech companies and fostering community growth was evident. However, I soon realized that the methodical, measured pace—while necessary for their position and responsibilities—wasn't aligned with my appetite for rapid innovation and growth.

This isn't a criticism of VIATEC or similar organizations. The slow, steady approach is often a requirement when working adjacent to government bodies. It's a game of careful consideration, stakeholder management, and long-term stability. But for someone who thrives on rapid iteration and measurable impact, this pace felt uncomfortably close to stagnation.

That's what led me to ShakePay. The opportunity to join their growth team represented everything I was looking for: a fast-paced environment where impact is measured in weeks, not years. In just my first 30 days at ShakePay, I've had the opportunity to drive more quantifiable change than I could in a year at VIATEC. The contrast is stark but illuminating.

This isn't just about personal preference—it's about understanding where you can make your most meaningful contribution. At ShakePay, every day brings new challenges in helping Canadians break free from traditional financial systems and build wealth through Bitcoin. The pace is relentless, the impact immediate, and the learning curve steep—exactly what I was seeking.

However, this transition hasn't diminished my commitment to Victoria's tech community. If anything, it's strengthened it. My experience at ShakePay has given me a new perspective on growth that I hope to bring back to Victoria. Whether through community organizations like Tenfold that I've built with friends, or through future collaborations with VIATEC, my goal is to help Victoria's tech ecosystem achieve the same kind of rapid growth I'm experiencing at ShakePay.

The lesson here isn't that one approach is better than the other—it's about finding the right fit for your personal growth trajectory. VIATEC continues to play a crucial role in Victoria's tech ecosystem, providing the stability and support that many companies need. Meanwhile, I've found my place in the high-growth world of fintech, where I can push the boundaries of what's possible in Canadian Bitcoin adoption.

As I look ahead, I'm excited about the possibility of bridging these two worlds. How can we bring the speed and innovation of high-growth companies to community development? How can we maintain stability while accelerating growth? These are the questions I'm eager to explore, and I believe the answers will help shape the future of Victoria's tech community.
